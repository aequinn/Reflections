Lesson 3 Reflections
1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If there is a large team project, working on a remote repository would be great. It would also
be a good idea if you weren't able to be on your own computer where the rest of your files were.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other code that people have committed to the remote may conflict with something you are working on.
You wouldn't want to disrupt what you are currently doing.
