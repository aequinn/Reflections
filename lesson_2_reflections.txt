Lesson 2 Reflections
1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a git folder was created that will hold all the details and 'meta' data for
the history of the repository. Without it there would be no way to track the changes.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
  What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area is a place to temporarily queue up the files you want to eventually
  commit together to the repository. This is nice because it might keep the size
  of your repository down
